# Snake
2018 Summer Side Project

The classical game of snake where the objective of the game is the grow your snake in length by consuming apples. The player is able to control an object using arrow keys and must avoid its primary obstacle itself.

The game is over when the snake covers the entirety of the board or when the snake collides with itself. Apple locations are randomly generated and every 10 apples eaten results in an increase of 1 level. There are a total of 10 levels, each level increase will result in a faster frame rate, thus making the game more difficult.

The game is meant to have all files included in a folder, with the main .java files compiled and to be RUN from the: 
SnakeMain.java class

Enjoy!
